Avoid the lines and fellow drunkards. Welcome to the one and only craft beer crawl that you can get to from the comfort of your living room.

**Instructions:**

1. Choose a bar patron

2. Choose a beer

3. Drink!

Your tolerance will deduct by the beer's ABV every time you drink. While the beer's ounces will go down by your drinking ability. As you keep drinking, your drinking ability (likely along with your dancing ability) will go up.

Try to make it to closing! If not, don't worry, I'll get you a ride.
